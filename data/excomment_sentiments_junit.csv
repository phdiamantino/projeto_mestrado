A link TestRule} may add additional checks that cause a test that would otherwise fail to pass or it may perform necessary setup or cleanup for tests or it may observe test execution to report it elsewhere. link TestRule}s can do everything that could be done previously with methods annotated with link org.junit.Before} link org.junit.After} link org.junit.BeforeClass} or link org.junit.AfterClass} but they are more powerful and more easily shared between projects and classes. The default JUnit test runners for suites and individual test cases recognize link TestRule}s introduced in two different ways. link org.junit.Rule} annotates methodlevel link TestRule}s and link org.junit.ClassRule} annotates classlevel link TestRule}s. See Javadoc for those annotations for more information. Multiple link TestRule}s can be applied to a test or suite execution. The link Statement} that executes the method or suite is passed to each annotated link org.junit.Rule} in turn and each may return a substitute or modified link Statement} which is passed to the next link org.junit.Rule} if any.

To make a test method a theory you mark it with <b>&amp064Theory<b>. To create a data point you create a public field in your test class and mark it with <b>&amp064DataPoint<b>. The Theories runner then executes your test method as many times as the number of data points declared providing a different data point as the input argument on each invocation. <p> <p> A Theory differs from standard test method in that it captures some aspect of the intended behavior in possibly infinite numbers of scenarios which corresponds to the number of data points declared. Using assumptions and assertions properly together with covering multiple scenarios with different data points can make your tests more flexible and bring them closer to scientific theories (hence the name. <p> <p> For example <pre> &amp064RunWith(<b>Theories.class<b> public class UserTest <b>&amp064DataPoint<b> public static String GOOD_USERNAME = optimus <b>&amp064DataPoint<b> public static String USERNAME_WITH_SLASH = optimusprime <b>&amp064Theory<b> public void filenameIncludesUsername(String username assumeThat(username not(containsString( assertThat(new User(username.configFileName( containsString(username } } <pre> This makes it clear that the username should be included in the config file name only if it doesn't contain a slash. Another test or theory might define what happens when a username does contain a slash. <code>UserTest<code> will attempt to run <code>filenameIncludesUsername<code> on every compatible data point defined in the class. If any of the assumptions fail the data point is silently ignored. If all of the assumptions pass but an assertion fails the test fails. If no parameters can be found that satisfy all assumptions the test fails. <p> Defining general statements as theories allows data point reuse across a bunch of functionality tests and also allows automated tools to search for new unexpected data points that expose bugs. <p> <p> The support for Theories has been absorbed from the Popper project and more complete documentation can be found from that projects archived documentation. <p> see <a href=httpweb.archive.orgweb20071012143326popper.tigris.orgtutorial.html>Archived Popper project documentation<a> see <a href=httpweb.archive.orgweb20110608210825httpshareandenjoy.saff.nettddspecifications.pdf>Paper on Theories<a>,14.5,1,theories runner allows test certain functionality subset infinite set data points p theory piece functionality method executed several data inputs called data points make test method theory mark bamptheoryb create data point create public field test class mark bampdatapointb theories runner executes test method many times number data points declared providing different data point input argument invocation p p theory differs standard test method captures aspect intended behavior possibly infinite numbers scenarios corresponds number data points declared using assumptions assertions properly together covering multiple scenarios different data points make tests flexible bring closer scientific theories hence name p p example pre amprunwithbtheoriesclassb public class usertest bampdatapointb public static string good_username optimus bampdatapointb public static string username_with_slash optimusprime bamptheoryb filenameincludesusernamestring username assumethatusername notcontainsstring assertthatnew userusernameconfigfilename containsstringusername pre makes clear username included config file name doesnt contain slash another test theory might define happens username contain slash codeusertestcode attempt run codefilenameincludesusernamecode every compatible data point defined class assumptions fail data point silently ignored assumptions pass assertion fails test fails parameters found satisfy assumptions test fails p defining general statements theories allows data point reuse across bunch functionality tests also allows automated tools search new unexpected data points expose bugs p p support theories absorbed popper project complete documentation found projects archived documentation p see hrefhttpwebarchiveorgwebpoppertigrisorgtutorialhtmlarchived popper project documentationa see hrefhttpwebarchiveorgwebhttpshareandenjoysaffnettddspecificationspdfpaper theoriesa the theory runner allows to test a certain functionality against a subset of an infinite set of data point p a theory is a piece of functionality a method that is executed against several data input called data point to make a test method a theory you mark it with bamptheoryb to create a data point you create a public field in your test class and mark it with bampdatapointb the theory runner then executes your test method a many time a the number of data point declared providing a different data point a the input argument on each invocation p p a theory differs from standard test method in that it capture some aspect of the intended behavior in possibly infinite number of scenario which corresponds to the number of data point declared using assumption and assertion properly together with covering multiple scenario with different data point can make your test more flexible and bring them closer to scientific theory hence the name p p for example pre amprunwithbtheoriesclassb public class usertest bampdatapointb public static string good_username optimus bampdatapointb public static string username_with_slash optimusprime bamptheoryb filenameincludesusernamestring username assumethatusername notcontainsstring assertthatnew userusernameconfigfilename containsstringusername pre this make it clear that the username should be included in the config file name only if it doesnt contain a slash another test or theory might define what happens when a username doe contain a slash codeusertestcode will attempt to run codefilenameincludesusernamecode on every compatible data point defined in the class if any of the assumption fail the data point is silently ignored if all of the assumption pas but an assertion fails the test fails if no parameter can be found that satisfy all assumption the test fails p defining general statement a theory allows data point reuse across a bunch of functionality test and also allows automated tool to search for new unexpected data point that expose bug p p the support for theory ha been absorbed from the popper project and more complete documentation can be found from that project archived documentation p see a hrefhttpwebarchiveorgwebpoppertigrisorgtutorialhtmlarchived popper project documentationa see a hrefhttpwebarchiveorgwebhttpshareandenjoysaffnettddspecificationspdfpaper on theoriesa,0

To define a test case<br> 1 implement a subclass of TestCase<br> 2 define instance variables that store the state of the fixture<br> 3 initialize the fixture state by overriding <code>setUp<code><br> 4 cleanup after a test by overriding <code>tearDown<code>.<br> Each test runs in its own fixture so there can be no side effects among test runs. Here is an example <pre> public class MathTest extends TestCase protected double fValue1 protected double fValue2 protected void setUp( fValue1= 2.0 fValue2= 3.0 } } <pre> For each test implement a method which interacts with the fixture. Verify the expected results with assertions specified by calling <code>assertTrue<code> with a boolean. <pre> public void testAdd( double result= fValue1 + fValue2 assertTrue(result == 5.0 } <pre> Once the methods are defined you can run them. The framework supports both a static type safe and more dynamic way to run a test. In the static way you override the runTest method and define the method to be invoked. A convenient way to do so is with an anonymous inner class. <pre> TestCase test= new MathTest(add public void runTest( testAdd( } } test.run( <pre> The dynamic way uses reflection to implement <code>runTest<code>. It dynamically finds and invokes a method. In this case the name of the test case has to correspond to the test method to be run. <pre> TestCase test= new MathTest(testAdd test.run( <pre> The tests to be run can be collected into a TestSuite. JUnit provides different <i>test runners<i> which can run a test suite and collect the results.

A link TestRule} may add additional checks that cause a test that would otherwise fail to pass or it may perform necessary setup or cleanup for tests or it may observe test execution to report it elsewhere. link TestRule}s can do everything that could be done previously with methods annotated with link org.junit.Before} link org.junit.After} link org.junit.BeforeClass} or link org.junit.AfterClass} but they are more powerful and more easily shared between projects and classes. The default JUnit test runners for suites and individual test cases recognize link TestRule}s introduced in two different ways. link org.junit.Rule} annotates methodlevel link TestRule}s and link org.junit.ClassRule} annotates classlevel link TestRule}s. See Javadoc for those annotations for more information. Multiple link TestRule}s can be applied to a test or suite execution. The link Statement} that executes the method or suite is passed to each annotated link org.junit.Rule} in turn and each may return a substitute or modified link Statement} which is passed to the next link org.junit.Rule} if any.

A link TestRule} may add additional checks that cause a test that would otherwise fail to pass or it may perform necessary setup or cleanup for tests or it may observe test execution to report it elsewhere. link TestRule}s can do everything that could be done previously with methods annotated with link org.junit.Before} link org.junit.After} link org.junit.BeforeClass} or link org.junit.AfterClass} but they are more powerful and more easily shared between projects and classes. The default JUnit test runners for suites and individual test cases recognize link TestRule}s introduced in two different ways. link org.junit.Rule} annotates methodlevel link TestRule}s and link org.junit.ClassRule} annotates classlevel link TestRule}s. See Javadoc for those annotations for more information. Multiple link TestRule}s can be applied to a test or suite execution. The link Statement} that executes the method or suite is passed to each annotated link org.junit.Rule} in turn and each may return a substitute or modified link Statement} which is passed to the next link org.junit.Rule} if any.

To make a test method a theory you mark it with <b>&amp064Theory<b>. To create a data point you create a public field in your test class and mark it with <b>&amp064DataPoint<b>. The Theories runner then executes your test method as many times as the number of data points declared providing a different data point as the input argument on each invocation. <p> <p> A Theory differs from standard test method in that it captures some aspect of the intended behavior in possibly infinite numbers of scenarios which corresponds to the number of data points declared. Using assumptions and assertions properly together with covering multiple scenarios with different data points can make your tests more flexible and bring them closer to scientific theories (hence the name. <p> <p> For example <pre> &amp064RunWith(<b>Theories.class<b> public class UserTest <b>&amp064DataPoint<b> public static String GOOD_USERNAME = optimus <b>&amp064DataPoint<b> public static String USERNAME_WITH_SLASH = optimusprime <b>&amp064Theory<b> public void filenameIncludesUsername(String username assumeThat(username not(containsString( assertThat(new User(username.configFileName( containsString(username } } <pre> This makes it clear that the user's filename should be included in the config file name only if it doesn't contain a slash. Another test or theory might define what happens when a username does contain a slash. <code>UserTest<code> will attempt to run <code>filenameIncludesUsername<code> on every compatible data point defined in the class. If any of the assumptions fail the data point is silently ignored. If all of the assumptions pass but an assertion fails the test fails. <p> Defining general statements as theories allows data point reuse across a bunch of functionality tests and also allows automated tools to search for new unexpected data points that expose bugs. <p> <p> The support for Theories has been absorbed from the Popper project and more complete documentation can be found from that projects archived documentation. <p> see <a href=httpweb.archive.orgweb20071012143326popper.tigris.orgtutorial.html>Archived Popper project documentation<a> see <a href=httpweb.archive.orgweb20110608210825httpshareandenjoy.saff.nettddspecifications.pdf>Paper on Theories<a>,10.0,1,theories runner allows test certain functionality subset infinite set data points p theory piece functionality method executed several data inputs called data points make test method theory mark bamptheoryb create data point create public field test class mark bampdatapointb theories runner executes test method many times number data points declared providing different data point input argument invocation p p theory differs standard test method captures aspect intended behavior possibly infinite numbers scenarios corresponds number data points declared using assumptions assertions properly together covering multiple scenarios different data points make tests flexible bring closer scientific theories hence name p p example pre amprunwithbtheoriesclassb public class usertest bampdatapointb public static string good_username optimus bampdatapointb public static string username_with_slash optimusprime bamptheoryb filenameincludesusernamestring username assumethatusername notcontainsstring assertthatnew userusernameconfigfilename containsstringusername pre makes clear users filename included config file name doesnt contain slash another test theory might define happens username contain slash codeusertestcode attempt run codefilenameincludesusernamecode every compatible data point defined class assumptions fail data point silently ignored assumptions pass assertion fails test fails p defining general statements theories allows data point reuse across bunch functionality tests also allows automated tools search new unexpected data points expose bugs p p support theories absorbed popper project complete documentation found projects archived documentation p see hrefhttpwebarchiveorgwebpoppertigrisorgtutorialhtmlarchived popper project documentationa see hrefhttpwebarchiveorgwebhttpshareandenjoysaffnettddspecificationspdfpaper theoriesa the theory runner allows to test a certain functionality against a subset of an infinite set of data point p a theory is a piece of functionality a method that is executed against several data input called data point to make a test method a theory you mark it with bamptheoryb to create a data point you create a public field in your test class and mark it with bampdatapointb the theory runner then executes your test method a many time a the number of data point declared providing a different data point a the input argument on each invocation p p a theory differs from standard test method in that it capture some aspect of the intended behavior in possibly infinite number of scenario which corresponds to the number of data point declared using assumption and assertion properly together with covering multiple scenario with different data point can make your test more flexible and bring them closer to scientific theory hence the name p p for example pre amprunwithbtheoriesclassb public class usertest bampdatapointb public static string good_username optimus bampdatapointb public static string username_with_slash optimusprime bamptheoryb filenameincludesusernamestring username assumethatusername notcontainsstring assertthatnew userusernameconfigfilename containsstringusername pre this make it clear that the user filename should be included in the config file name only if it doesnt contain a slash another test or theory might define what happens when a username doe contain a slash codeusertestcode will attempt to run codefilenameincludesusernamecode on every compatible data point defined in the class if any of the assumption fail the data point is silently ignored if all of the assumption pas but an assertion fails the test fails p defining general statement a theory allows data point reuse across a bunch of functionality test and also allows automated tool to search for new unexpected data point that expose bug p p the support for theory ha been absorbed from the popper project and more complete documentation can be found from that project archived documentation p see a hrefhttpwebarchiveorgwebpoppertigrisorgtutorialhtmlarchived popper project documentationa see a hrefhttpwebarchiveorgwebhttpshareandenjoysaffnettddspecificationspdfpaper on theoriesa,0

A link TestRule} may add additional checks that cause a test that would otherwise fail to pass or it may perform necessary setup or cleanup for tests or it may observe test execution to report it elsewhere. link TestRule}s can do everything that could be done previously with methods annotated with link org.junit.Before} link org.junit.After} link org.junit.BeforeClass} or link org.junit.AfterClass} but they are more powerful and more easily shared between projects and classes. The default JUnit test runners for suites and individual test cases recognize link TestRule}s introduced in two different ways. link org.junit.Rule} annotates methodlevel link TestRule}s and link org.junit.ClassRule} annotates classlevel link TestRule}s. See Javadoc for those annotations for more information. Multiple link TestRule}s can be applied to a test or suite execution. The link Statement} that executes the method or suite is passed to each annotated link org.junit.Rule} in turn and each may return a substitute or modified link Statement} which is passed to the next link org.junit.Rule} if any.

The framework supports both a static type safe and more dynamic way to run a test. In the static way you override the runTest method and define the method to be invoked. A convenient way to do so is with an anonymous inner class. <pre> TestCase test= new MathTest(add public void runTest( testAdd( } } test.run( <pre> The dynamic way uses reflection to implement link runTest(}.

A link TestRule} may add additional checks that cause a test that would otherwise fail to pass or it may perform necessary setup or cleanup for tests or it may observe test execution to report it elsewhere. link TestRule}s can do everything that could be done previously with methods annotated with link org.junit.Before} link org.junit.After} link org.junit.BeforeClass} or link org.junit.AfterClass} but they are more powerful and more easily shared between projects and classes. The default JUnit test runners for suites and individual test cases recognize link TestRule}s introduced in two different ways. link org.junit.Rule} annotates methodlevel link TestRule}s and link org.junit.ClassRule} annotates classlevel link TestRule}s. See Javadoc for those annotations for more information. Multiple link TestRule}s can be applied to a test or suite execution. The link Statement} that executes the method or suite is passed to each annotated link org.junit.Rule} in turn and each may return a substitute or modified link Statement} which is passed to the next link org.junit.Rule} if any.
